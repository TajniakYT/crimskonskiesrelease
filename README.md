Ok this is right now very basic and barebones clone of ace combat and project wingman
Basically you only have exe file to launch, no menu no missions no nonsense
Just stupid flying with some targets
But hey! At least this is something and way better whan whatever the hell
I did last semester

Feedback is appreciated

Windows only and supports controllers (I think)
Keyboard not recomended (why would you play ace combat clone on it anyway?)
